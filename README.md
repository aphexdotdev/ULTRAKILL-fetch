# ULTRAKILL your terminal

To use this you need [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch), it's not neofetch but it's better. I may make a neofetch version soon.
To install simply git clone into your fastfetch directory at `/home/.config/fastfetch`. 
All you need is the config.jsonc but I also added ULTRAKILL's font (VCR OSD) if you wanna use it in your terminal and the V1 ASCII art.
