# ULTRAKILL your terminal

To use this you need [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch), it's not neofetch but it's better and maintained. I may make a neofetch version soon.

To install simply place the config.jsonc into your fastfetch directory at `/home/.config/fastfetch` (on Linux), and customize it to your heart's desire if you feel like it. 

All you need is the config.jsonc indeed but I also added ULTRAKILL's font (VCR OSD) if you wanna use it in your terminal and the V1 ASCII art.
